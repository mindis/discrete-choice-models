The codes are made available under a GNU General Public License 3.0 and available through my GitHub repository. Use of the codes should be acknowledged either by citing the codes themselves or a relevant paper. The codes are made available without warranty and with the knowledge that all codes may contain bugs and errors, and the author cannot be held liable for this. All codes and functions are interlinked to work together to handle data set-up, search for starting values, parallel estimation and output, and will save certain output files to your working directory. Please be prepared to spend a significant amount of time familiarizing yourself with the codes prior to use. I have done my best to comment the codes and make them readable.

The current version of the codes allows for estimation of various specifications of the multinomial logit model, latent class model and mixed logit model. Computers with processors containing multiple cores can utilize parallel processing.

I will make additional codes available over time. If you find any bugs or errors, please let me know.

- The codes for calculating standard errors for correlation in multivariate normal distributions and generating Modified Latin Hypercube Sampling (MLHS) draws were obtained from Stephane Hess.

- The code for generating scrambled Halton sequences is a translation of the GAUSS codes provided by Chandra Bhat.

- I have drawn inspiration in the development of these codes from the extensive and excellent Matlab codes written by Mikolaj Czajkowski, and from the R packages 'mlogit' and 'gmnl'.
